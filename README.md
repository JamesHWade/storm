## Overview [(Try STORM now!)](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/)

<p align="center">

</p>
STORM is a LLM system that writes Wikipedia-like articles from scratch based on Internet search.

While the system cannot produce publication-ready articles that often require a significant number of edits, experienced Wikipedia editors have found it helpful in their pre-writing stage.

**Try out our [live research preview](https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/) to see how STORM can help your knowledge exploration journey and please provide feedback to help us improve the system üôè!**



## How STORM works

STORM breaks down generating long articles with citations into two steps:
1. **Pre-writing stage**: The system conducts Internet-based research to collect references and generates an outline.
2. **Writing stage**: The system uses the outline and references to generate the full-length article with citations.
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/two_stages.jpg" style="width: 60%; height: auto;">
</p>

STORM identifies the core of automating the research process as automatically coming up with good questions to ask. Directly prompting the language model to ask questions does not work well. To improve the depth and breadth of the questions, STORM adopts two strategies:
1. **Perspective-Guided Question Asking**: Given the input topic, STORM discovers different perspectives by surveying existing articles from similar topics and uses them to control the question-asking process.
2. **Simulated Conversation**: STORM simulates a conversation between a Wikipedia writer and a topic expert grounded in Internet sources to enable the language model to update its understanding of the topic and ask follow-up questions.

Based on the separation of the two stages, STORM is implemented in a highly modular way using [dspy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy).



## Installation


To install the knowledge storm library, use `pip install knowledge-storm`. 

You could also install the source code which allows you to modify the behavior of STORM engine directly.
1. Clone the git repository.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm.git
    cd storm
    ```
   
2. Install the required packages.
   ```shell
   conda create -n storm python=3.11
   conda activate storm
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   

## API
The STORM knowledge curation engine is defined as a simple Python `STORMWikiRunner` class.

As STORM is working in the information curation layer, you need to set up the information retrieval module and language model module to create a `STORMWikiRunner` instance. Here is an example of using You.com search engine and OpenAI models.
```python
import os
from knowledge_storm import STORMWikiRunnerArguments, STORMWikiRunner, STORMWikiLMConfigs
from knowledge_storm.lm import OpenAIModel
from knowledge_storm.rm import YouRM

lm_configs = STORMWikiLMConfigs()
openai_kwargs = {
    'api_key': os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    'temperature': 1.0,
    'top_p': 0.9,
}
# STORM is a LM system so different components can be powered by different models to reach a good balance between cost and quality.
# For a good practice, choose a cheaper/faster model for `conv_simulator_lm` which is used to split queries, synthesize answers in the conversation.
# Choose a more powerful model for `article_gen_lm` to generate verifiable text with citations.
gpt_35 = OpenAIModel(model='gpt-3.5-turbo', max_tokens=500, **openai_kwargs)
gpt_4 = OpenAIModel(model='gpt-4o', max_tokens=3000, **openai_kwargs)
lm_configs.set_conv_simulator_lm(gpt_35)
lm_configs.set_question_asker_lm(gpt_35)
lm_configs.set_outline_gen_lm(gpt_4)
lm_configs.set_article_gen_lm(gpt_4)
lm_configs.set_article_polish_lm(gpt_4)
# Check out the STORMWikiRunnerArguments class for more configurations.
engine_args = STORMWikiRunnerArguments(...)
rm = YouRM(ydc_api_key=os.getenv('YDC_API_KEY'), k=engine_args.search_top_k)
runner = STORMWikiRunner(engine_args, lm_configs, rm)
```

Currently, our package support:
- `OpenAIModel`, `AzureOpenAIModel`, `ClaudeModel`, `VLLMClient`, `TGIClient`, `TogetherClient`, `OllamaClient`, `GoogleModel`, `DeepSeekModel`, `GroqModel` as language model components
- `YouRM`, `BingSearch`, `VectorRM`, `SerperRM`, `BraveRM`, `SearXNG`, `DuckDuckGoSearchRM`, `TavilySearchRM`, `GoogleSearch` as retrieval module components

:star2: **PRs for integrating more language models into [knowledge_storm/lm.py](knowledge_storm/lm.py) and search engines/retrievers into [knowledge_storm/rm.py](knowledge_storm/rm.py) are highly appreciated!**

The `STORMWikiRunner` instance can be evoked with the simple `run` method:
```python
topic = input('Topic: ')
runner.run(
    topic=topic,
    do_research=True,
    do_generate_outline=True,
    do_generate_article=True,
    do_polish_article=True,
)
runner.post_run()
runner.summary()
```
- `do_research`: if True, simulate conversations with difference perspectives to collect information about the topic; otherwise, load the results.
- `do_generate_outline`: if True, generate an outline for the topic; otherwise, load the results.
- `do_generate_article`: if True, generate an article for the topic based on the outline and the collected information; otherwise, load the results.
- `do_polish_article`: if True, polish the article by adding a summarization section and (optionally) removing duplicate content; otherwise, load the results.


## Quick Start with Example Scripts

We provide scripts in our [examples folder](examples) as a quick start to run STORM with different configurations.

**To run STORM with `gpt` family models with default configurations:**
1. We suggest using `secrets.toml` to set up the API keys. Create a file `secrets.toml` under the root directory and add the following content:
    ```shell
    # Set up OpenAI API key.
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    # If you are using the API service provided by OpenAI, include the following line:
    OPENAI_API_TYPE="openai"
    # If you are using the API service provided by Microsoft Azure, include the following lines:
    OPENAI_API_TYPE="azure"
    AZURE_API_BASE="your_azure_api_base_url"
    AZURE_API_VERSION="your_azure_api_version"
    # Set up You.com search API key.
    YDC_API_KEY="your_youcom_api_key"
    ```
2. Run the following command.
    ```
    python examples/run_storm_wiki_gpt.py \
        --output-dir $OUTPUT_DIR \
        --retriever you \
        --do-research \
        --do-generate-outline \
        --do-generate-article \
        --do-polish-article
    ```

**To run STORM using your favorite language models or grounding on your own corpus:** Check out [examples/README.md](examples/README.md).


## Customization of the Pipeline

If you have installed the source code, you can customize STORM based on your own use case. STORM engine consists of 4 modules:

1. Knowledge Curation Module: Collects a broad coverage of information about the given topic.
2. Outline Generation Module: Organizes the collected information by generating a hierarchical outline for the curated knowledge.
3. Article Generation Module: Populates the generated outline with the collected information.
4. Article Polishing Module: Refines and enhances the written article for better presentation.

The interface for each module is defined in `knowledge_storm/interface.py`, while their implementations are instantiated in `knowledge_storm/storm_wiki/modules/*`. These modules can be customized according to your specific requirements (e.g., generating sections in bullet point format instead of full paragraphs).


## Replicate NAACL2024 result

Please switch to the branch `NAACL-2024-code-backup` [here](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm/tree/NAACL-2024-code-backup).



## Roadmap & Contributions
Our team is actively working on:
1. Human-in-the-Loop Functionalities: Supporting user participation in the knowledge curation process.
2. Information Abstraction: Developing abstractions for curated information to support presentation formats beyond the Wikipedia-style report.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. We welcome contributions to improve the system and the codebase!
